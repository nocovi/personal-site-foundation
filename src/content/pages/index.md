+12 years in different types of Global projects on multiple technologies, loving Salesforce from 2011 and working on Global Salesforce projects applying Best Practices, Code Guidelines and Design Patterns. I consider myself to be a dynamic person who enjoys challenges and it's able to confront a blank page.
